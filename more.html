            <h3>Cybersecurity Analyst | Data Analyst | Business Analyst</h3>
            <p>
               I’m a Business and Data Analytics professional with over four years of experience bridging the gap between technology and strategy. My background spans roles in Data Analysis, Business Analysis, Systems Support, and Cybersecurity, where I’ve led cross-functional projects that improved processes, enhanced digital security, and delivered meaningful insights across enterprise systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently pursuing a Master’s in Business Analytics at William & Mary, I specialize in turning complex data into clear decisions—leveraging tools like SQL, Python, Tableau, Power BI, and Excel to optimize operations and drive business value. From improving Postilion payment infrastructure and supporting digital banking at CBZ Holdings, to developing dashboards and vulnerability assessments at Ai SPARK and BancABC, I’ve consistently used data to make systems smarter and more secure.
            </p>
            <p>
              While my core focus is in analytics and strategic decision-making, my cybersecurity expertise—including ethical hacking, cloud security, and PCI DSS compliance—gives me a unique edge in managing risk and building resilient, data-driven organizations.

Whether I’m solving business problems, strengthening system reliability, or creating secure and scalable data solutions, I bring a thoughtful, technical, and mission-driven approach to every challenge
